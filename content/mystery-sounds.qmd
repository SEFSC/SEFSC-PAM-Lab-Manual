Ask the broader community on the [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/){target="_blank"}!

Follow the steps below to set up an account, share your sound, and post your question

### Login or Create Stack Exchange Account

Skip to ['Post a Question'](https://sefsc.github.io/SEFSC-PAM-Lab-Manual/content/Data-mystery-sounds.qmd#post-a-question) if you already have an account

3.  Follow the directions to complete you profile

### Post a Question

1.  Go to the [Bioacoustics Stack Exchange](https://bioacoustics.stackexchange.com/){target="_blank"} and click the blue 'Ask Question' button

2.  Give a brief but descriptive title, make sure to include some basic information about the sound (frequency range, location, etc)

    -   *Example title: "Mysterious pulsed sound from seafloor hydrophone off Kamchatka in spring 2022"*

3.  In the body of the question, give an in depth description of the sound and include the location and time of year. Also include information about the recording platform, hydrophone, and any other information to help people help you

    -   *Example description: "This sound has been recorded in early to late winter (January/February) on the shelf (25 m depth) off the US state of Georgia in the Western North Atlantic. The data was from a moored Soundtrap 600 with an HTI-96 hydrophone, recording at 288 kHz. There appears to be stacked harmonics that are frequency modulated. Audibly, they sound like they may originate from a marine mammal in my opinion."*

4.  Include at least one image of the spectrogram of the sound. You can also include images of other examples of the sound or the waveform.

5.  Add the tags 'mystery-sound', 'species-identification', and any others you think are relevant
