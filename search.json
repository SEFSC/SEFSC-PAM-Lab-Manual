It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages .

    "text": "Towed Hydrophone Array\nWhile at sea conducting line-transect surveys to look for whales and dolphins (cetaceans), acousticians deploy a towed hydrophone (underwater microphone) array. The array is towed approximately 300 meters behind the ship to detect and localize the sounds produced by toothed whales and dolphins (odontocetes).\nThe array contains multiple hydrophones, each recording sounds as they arrive. The time differences in sound arrival on each hydrophone allow us to measure the sound’s direction. As the ship continues on its path, the direction to the sounds changes. This allows scientists to localize the source of whistles and echolocation clicks.\nThese data can be used to estimate the spatial distribution, density, and abundance of toothed whale and dolphin species. They offer complementary data to visual observations for use in marine mammal stock assessments. Additionally, the associated visual and acoustic detections can help us learn what call types are produced by each species.\n *A hydrophone array being towed behind the ship. This array is towed 300 m behind the ship and usually stays submerged between nine and 12 meters (30-40 feet) depth. We use a custom-built modular array capable of recording a broad range of sound frequencies. Credit: NOAA Fisheries / Amanda Debich",

    "text": "Drifting Acoustic Recorders\n\nSonobuoys\nDuring ship surveys, we also use expendable DIFAR (Directional Frequency Analysis and Ranging) sonobuoys to detect and record low‐frequency sounds produced by baleen whales (mysticetes). DIFAR sonobuoys contain a hydrophone and a compass in the sensor head and transmit signals from these sensors back to the ship via a VHF radio carrier. The acoustic signal ranges in frequency from 10–4,000 hertz, which is well suited for baleen whale calls that are generally below 1,000 hertz. The two compass signals contain directional information that help us determine where the sounds we hear are coming from and can be used to help us find and localize whales.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Fisheries Science Center scientists deploy pairs of these sonobuoys to localize the source of calls that are thought to be produced by the endangered Rice’s whale. This provides data to understand what types of calls these whales produce, how often they produce them, and in some cases, how far away we can detect the calls from them. We need this foundational information about what calls Rice’s whales produce to use autonomous moored recorders for longer term studies of their occurrence.",

These tags provide us with a view of what whales and dolphins do below the surface. They allow us to measure their dive depth, movements, and behavior, and record the sounds produced near and by the tagged animal.\nThe tags attach to the whale’s back via suction cups and remain on the whale for a few hours to a few days. Once they detach from the whales, we use satellite and VHF transmitters to locate and recover them and access the recorded data. These dive data, combined with acoustic recordings from the tag, give us insight into the acoustic behavior of these animals. They help us learn about the animals’ vocal cue rates and how the calls they produce relate to their behavior underwater. This helps us to interpret the data we collect with other passive acoustic tools.\n *An AcousondeTM tag, attached to a whale via suction cups, provides acoustic and kinematic data to learn about whale calling and dive behavior.
