## NCEI Data Archive

All [LISTEN GoMex](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/passive-acoustic-research-southeast-fisheries-science-center#listen-gomex) raw data (xwavs) will be or are publicly accessible through [NCEI Passive Acoustics Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/passive-acoustic-data).


## OBIS-SEAMAP

We will be archiving the 2020-2023 LISTEN GoMex marine mammal detection data in the [OBIS-SEAMAP](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/) database.


## PACM

The [Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacm/#/), or PACM, is a visual representation of acosutic detections of species. The 2020-2023 LISTEN GoMex marine mammal detection data are archived and available to view on the PACM.


## Tethys

The LISTEN GoMex deployment metadata and detection data are archived in our lab's Tethys database.



<!-- A data management section is required and should include the following information; -->

<!-- -   Data Archive Methods -->
<!--     -   Information on where your data is archived (PACM, NCEI, Tethys, Internal databases, etc) -->
<!--     -   [SAEL Example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-Archive.html) -->
<!-- -   Species reference guide for your region -->
<!--     -   Develop a species and call type library for your region -->
<!--     -   This can include spectrograms of calls and sound clips -->
<!--     -   PIFSC working on this, use them as an example once finalized -->
<!--     -   [SAEL Example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Data-SpeciesAndCallTypes.html) -->
<!-- -   Media -->
<!--     -   Links to sound archives, media archives, web sites, blogs, etc. -->
